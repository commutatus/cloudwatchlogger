Overview
--------

Send logged messages to [AWS CloudWatch Logs](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/DeveloperGuide/WhatIsCloudWatchLogs.html) using the ruby [AWS SDK](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkforruby/api/index.html).

Can be used in place of Ruby's Logger
(<http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/logger/rdoc/>)

In fact, it (currently) returns an instance of Logger.

Forked from (<https://github.com/zshannon/cloudwatchlogger>).
